## Harden WMI and DCOM to Prevent Remote Execution on a Windows Domain Controller

To reduce the risk of remote code execution via WMI and DCOM on your domain controllers, you should tighten both access controls and network boundaries. Here are several strategies:

### Harden WMI

- **Restrict Namespace Permissions:**  
  Review and limit the permissions on critical WMI namespaces (such as `root\CIMv2`). Remove any unnecessary user or group permissions so that only trusted administrators or service accounts can query or execute WMI commands.

- **Use Group Policy for Consistency:**  
  Deploy WMI security settings via Group Policy to ensure that all domain controllers have uniform, restrictive access policies.

- **Enable Auditing:**  
  Configure WMI auditing to track access attempts and potential abuse. Monitoring these events can help detect anomalous behavior early.

### Harden DCOM

- **Tighten DCOM Launch and Activation Permissions:**  
  Use the `dcomcnfg` tool (or equivalent Group Policy settings) to restrict which users or groups have remote launch and activation rights. Only allow accounts that absolutely need this level of access.

- **Limit DCOM Endpoint Access:**  
  Configure your firewall to restrict inbound connections to the DCOM dynamic port range (typically above 1024). Consider using network segmentation to limit exposure of domain controllers.

- **Enforce Strong Authentication:**  
  Ensure that only authenticated and authorized accounts can access DCOM services. Use secure channel configurations and, if possible, enforce mutual authentication.

### Additional Best Practices

- **Disable Unused Services:**  
  If remote WMI or DCOM isnâ€™t required on your domain controllers, consider disabling these services entirely to reduce the attack surface.

- **Regularly Review and Update Security Policies:**  
  Periodically audit and adjust security settings as part of your overall risk management process. This includes reviewing Group Policy settings, firewall rules, and any custom configurations.

- **Monitor and Log Activity:**  
  Implement centralized logging and monitoring solutions to detect unusual access patterns or privilege escalations involving WMI or DCOM.

By following these guidelines, you can significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized remote execution via WMI or DCOM on your domain controllers.
